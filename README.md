If you want to use this system in your projects, download "Turbowarp Multiplayer Engine 2.0.sb3", open it in Turbowarp, and backpack every sprite. If you need help, DM me on Discord: that_pi_guy

If you want a fun place where you can draw and chat with people, https://0106harvey.github.io/Turbowarp-Multiplayer-Engine-2.0/ is your place! If you want the source code for it, it's at "Turbowarp Multiplayer Engine 2.0 DEMO.sb3"

Features of the multiplayer engine:

Auto-joining and auto-leaving

Smooth, lossless data transfer

Developer-friendly interface (I hope)
